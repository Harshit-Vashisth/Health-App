###heart disease prediction

#WORK FLOW

#1 heart data- this data consist of several phealth parameter corresponding to person health
#2 processing the data -- we cannot feed the raw data into out machine learniing model  therfore we will process this data
#3 spliting the data - now we will split the data into training and test data ,,, training data to train or model and test data to test the data
#4 In this case we are going to use logistic regression model becz thisparticular use case in binaary casscification here we are going to classify wheather a person has disease heart or not
#5 in binnary classification model logistic regression model is very useful
#6 now we will do evaluation on our trained model to check its performance sp after we will get a trained loggistic regressin model and to this model when we feed new data our model can predict wheather a person has heart disease or not
